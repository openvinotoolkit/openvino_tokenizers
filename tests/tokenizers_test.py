    "<s>[INST] <<SYS>> A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. <</SYS>> You will act as a Christian, and fully summarize following text:\nSometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been 10 years since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this: My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy.If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven. Thanks. [/INST]",

    "Originally, There were three types of cake in the cake store: Strawberry Cream Cake, Chocolate Coconut Cake, and Red Velvet Brownie Cake. Customer number is large enough so that no cake would be left every day when the store close. As the name suggested, each cake has two ingredients: Strawberry Cream Cake with strawberries and cream, Chocolate Coconut Cake with chocolate and coconut, and Red Velvet Brownie Cake with red velvet and brownie. Different ingredients can be compatibly mixed with each other without any issue. After the cake is made, there are often some leftover materials for each ingredient. In order to reduce waste, the store often combine the extra ingredients in pairs to make new small gifts to gain extra sales. For example, strawberries and chocolate can be mixed to create strawberry-flavored chocolate sauce, and brownies and shredded coconut can be mixed to create brownie coconut cookies. Only two ingredients can be mixed, and mixture with more than two ingredients can cost a lot of time and will not be adopted. In order to decrease the problem complexity, the store will also prevent from careful decorations or other difficult steps as in procedure of making cakes, so that time cost can be omited. By analogy, if all the ingredients can be combined in pairs, what small products can the store make in the end?",
    "There is a table, which contains three drawers: left drawer, middle drawer and right drawer; Tom Ethan, Elbert Alex, Jack Johnson, and Mario Thompson all saw a bag of chocolates on the table. Tom Ethan asked Elbert Alex and Jack Johnson to go out, and after that, he put the bag of chocolates in the right drawer in front of Mario Thompson; after Jack Johnson came back, Tom Ethan asked Mario Thompson to go out to find Elbert Alex, and took it from the left drawer in front of Jack Johnson. Then He take out a box of biscuits and put them in the middle drawer; when Elbert Alex and Mario Thompson returned, Tom Ethan asked Jack Johnson and Mario Thompson to go out to buy a bottle of soy sauce. Tom Ethan waited for a long time, and found that Jack Johnson and Mario Thompson had not returned, so he sent Elbert Alex to look for them, but in the end only Jack Johnson and Elbert Alex came back. Jack Johnson told Tom Ethan that at first they could not find any shop that is providing soy sauce, so they had to separate to search other shops, which is why Mario Thompson got lost; on the way back, Jack Johnson ran into Elbert Alex, and they rushed back first. Therefore, Tom Ethan asked them to go out to find Mario Thompson again; in order to prevent getting lost again, Tom Ethan told Elbert Alex and Jack Johnson to walk together at all time, and even if they could not get the soy sauce, they had to find and get back with Mario Thompson. As a result, Elbert Alex and Jack Johnson found Mario Thompson outside and found that he had bought a bottle of soy sauce. The three felt that Tom Ethan never went out to do anthing but they are busy all the time. So they were very angry. They discussed and made a conclusion. After going back to see Tom Ethan, they should not tell him about the soy sauce they bought, and asked Jack Johnson to hide the soy sauce in his backpack. After the three of them came back together, they pretended to claim that they did not foudn and bought soy sauce according to the plan, and hoped that Tom Ethan would go out together to buy things in the future, and he should not be so lazy. Tom Ethan agreed and felt sory about that. When everyone finally stood in front of the table, the four of them wrote down the list of items they knew and the location of the items. So the question is: is the information writen by these four people consistent, and why?",
    "The process of Origami seems simple at the first glance, but in fact, it still requires a very complicated process to do it well. Taking folding a rose as an example, we can divide the entire process into three stages, including: firstly creating a grid of creases, secondly making a three-dimensional base, and thirdly finishing petal decoration. The first step is to create a grid of creases: this step is a bit like the first step of folding a gift of thousand-paper-crane. That is to say, we can fold the paper in half (or namedly equal-folds) through the symmetrical axis, and repeat such step in the other symmetrical axis. And then apply multiple equal-folds in sequence relative to each smaller rectangle divided by the two creases; After that, the creases in each direction will interweave into a complete set of uniform small square splicing patterns; these small squares form a reference space similar to a two-dimensional coordinate system, allowing us to combine adjacent creases on the plane from Three-dimensional high platforms or depressions are folded on the two-dimensional small squares to facilitate the next steps of folding. It should be noted that, in the process of creating grid creases, there may be rare cases when the folds are not aligned. The consequences of this error can be very serious. And just like the butterfly effect, it is only a slight difference at the beginning , and in the end it may generate a disaster world which is completely different from plan. Anyway, let's continue. The second step is make the three-dimensional base: In this step, we need to fold a set of symmetrical three-dimensional high platforms or depressions based on the grid creases. From the symmetry analysis, it is not difficult to find that the rose will have four symmetrical three-dimensional high platforms and supporting depressions. Therefore, we can firstly fold out a quarter of the depression and plateau patterns, which would help build a base to compose into a complex 3D structure. And then, we use this quarter as a template, and fold out the repeating patterns on the remaining three parts of the whole structure in turn. It is worth noting that the layout of the high platform not only needs to consider the regular contrast and symmetrical distribution of the length and width, but also needs to ensure the orderliness of the height dimension. This is very important, since we will never go back to this step after all parts were made, and you would better start from first step if you make anything wrong in the this step. Similar to the precautions in the first stage, please handle all the corners in three dimensions to ensure that they conform to the layout required in the plan, which would help us avoid the butterfly effect and increase the robustness in the process of three-dimensional folding. Just like building a skyscrapper in the real world, people usually take a lot of time when building the base but soon get finished when extending the structure after that. Time is worth to cost in the base, but would be saved in the future after you succeed in base. Anyway, let's continue. During the first quarter of the pattern, repeated comparisons with the finished rose were made to eliminate any possible errors in the first place. The final stage is to finish the petal grooming. At this stage, we often emphasize an important term called folding-by-heart. The intention here is no longer literally serious, but focus is moved to our understanding of the shape of a rose in nature, and we usually use natural curves to continuously correct the shape of petals in order to approach the shape of rose petals in reality. One more comment: this is also the cause of randomness to the art, which can be generated differently by different people. Recall that rose should be adjusted close to reality, so in the last step of this stage, we need to open the bloom in the center of the rose, by pulling on the four petals that have been bent. This process may be accompanied by the collapse of the overall structure of the rose, so we should be very careful to save strength of adjustment, and it must be well controlled to avoid irreversible consequences. Ultimately, after three stages of folding, we end up with a crown of rose with a similar shape close to reality. If condition is permited, we can wrap a green paper strip twisted on a straightened iron wire, and insert the rose crown we just created onto one side of the iron wire. In this way, we got a hand-made rose with a green stem. We can also repeat the steps above to increase the number of rose, so that it can be made into a cluster. Different color of rose is usually more attractive and can be considered as a better plan of gift to your friend. In summary, by creating a grid of creases, making a three-dimensional base, and finishing with petals, we created a three-dimensional rose from a two-dimensional paper. Although this process may seem simple, it is indeed a work of art created by us humans with the help of imagination and common materials. At last, Please comment to assess the above content.",

    "折纸的过程看似简单，其实想要做好，还是需要一套很复杂的工艺。以折一支玫瑰花为例，我们可以将整个折纸过程分成三个阶段，即：创建栅格折痕，制作立体基座，完成花瓣修饰。首先是创建栅格折痕：这一步有点像我们折千纸鹤的第一步，即通过对称州依次对折，然后按照长和宽两个维度，依次进行多等分的均匀折叠；最终在两个方向上的折痕会交织成一套完整均匀的小方格拼接图案；这些小方格就组成了类似二维坐标系的参考系统，使得我们在该平面上，通过组合临近折痕的方式从二维小方格上折叠出三维的高台或凹陷，以便于接下来的几座制作过程。需要注意的是，在建立栅格折痕的过程中，可能会出现折叠不对成的情况，这种错误所带来的后果可能是很严重的，就像是蝴蝶效应，一开始只是毫厘之差，最后可能就是天壤之别。然后是制作立体基座：在这一步，我们需要基于栅格折痕折出对称的三维高台或凹陷。从对称性分析不难发现，玫瑰花会有四个周对称的三维高台和配套凹陷。所以，我们可以先折出四分之一的凹陷和高台图案，然后以这四分之一的部分作为摸板，再依次折出其余三个部分的重复图案。值得注意的是，高台的布局不仅要考虑长和宽这两个唯独上的规整衬度和对称分布，还需要同时保证高这个维度上的整齐。与第一阶段的注意事项类似，请处理好三个维度上的所有折角，确保它们符合计划中所要求的那种布局，以免出现三维折叠过程中的蝴蝶效应；为此，我们常常会在折叠第一个四分之一图案的过程中，与成品玫瑰花进行反复比较，以便在第一时间排除掉所有可能的错误。最后一个阶段是完成花瓣修饰。在这个阶段，我们往往强调一个重要名词，叫用心折叠。这里的用心已经不是字面上的认真这个意思，而是指通过我们对于大自然中玫瑰花外型的理解，借助自然的曲线去不断修正花瓣的形状，以期逼近现实中的玫瑰花瓣外形。请注意，在这个阶段的最后一步，我们需要通过拉扯已经弯折的四个花瓣，来调整玫瑰花中心的绽放程度。这个过程可能会伴随玫瑰花整体结构的崩塌，所以，一定要控制好调整的力道，以免出现不可逆的后果。最终，经过三个阶段的折叠，我们会得到一支栩栩如生的玫瑰花冠。如果条件允许，我们可以在一根拉直的铁丝上缠绕绿色纸条，并将玫瑰花冠插在铁丝的一段。这样，我们就得到了一支手工玫瑰花。总之，通过创建栅格折痕，制作立体基座，以及完成花瓣修饰，我们从二维的纸面上创作出了一支三维的花朵。这个过程虽然看似简单，但它确实我们人类借助想象力和常见素材而创作出的艺术品。请赏析以上内容的精妙之处。",

    "<s>[INST] <<SYS>> A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. <</SYS>> You will act as a Christian, and fully summarize following text:\nSometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been 10 years since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this: My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy.If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven. Thanks. [/INST]",
